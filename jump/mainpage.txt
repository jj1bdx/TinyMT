 *
 * This is status jump program for Tiny Mersenne Twister.
 *
 * Jump means changing internal state vector to n steps
 * after current state without generating numbers.
 *
 * The following function are available.
 * - calculate_jump_polynomial(): calculate jump polynomial from jump step
 * and characteristic polynomial. This function can be used for 32-bit and
 * 64-bit tinymt. This function is time consuming.
 * - tinymt32_jump_by_polynomial(): actual jump using jump polynomial for
 * tinymt32. This function is not as time consuming as calculating jump
 * polynomial.
 * - tinymt64_jump_by_polynomial(): actual jump using jump polynomial for
 * tinymt64. This function is not as time consuming as calculating jump
 * polynomial.
 * - tinymt32_jump():This function calculates jump polynomial and jumps
 * using the polynomial.
 * - tinymt64_jump(): This function calculates jump polynomial and jumps
 * using the polynomial.
